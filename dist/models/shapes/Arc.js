/**
 * @fileoverview Circular arc -- an open curve segment traced along a circle between two
 * angles.
 *
 * Angles are specified in degrees (not radians) for user friendliness in the Properties
 * Panel.  They are converted to radians internally inside toGeometryPath().  The arc
 * spans from startAngle to endAngle measured clockwise from the positive X axis (0 deg =
 * 3 o'clock, 90 deg = 6 o'clock in canvas coordinates where Y increases downward).
 *
 * The path is open (not closed), but containsPoint uses a FILL-based hit test rather
 * than a stroke-based one.  This works because {@link styleContainsPoint} treats the
 * implicit chord (the straight line from the last sampled point back to the first) as
 * part of the filled area.  The resulting hit region is a pie-slice / circular segment,
 * which is more generous than a thin stroke and feels more natural when clicking near
 * the arc's endpoints.
 *
 * The arc is sampled as 32 line segments.  32 is sufficient for smooth appearance on
 * arcs spanning up to 360 degrees; shorter arcs use proportionally fewer visible
 * segments but always produce 32 sample points regardless of the angle span.
 *
