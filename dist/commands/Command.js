/**
 * @fileoverview Command base class — the unit of undoable work in Otto.
 *
 * Every model mutation flows through a Command executed (or recorded) on the
 * active tab's {@link HistoryManager}. This replaces the old memento system,
 * which serialized the ENTIRE scene 300ms after every event: commands are
 * granular (undo restores exactly what changed), cheap (no full-scene
 * snapshots), and self-describing (labels for future UI).
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - `execute(scene)` applies the change; `undo(scene)` reverts it exactly.
 *     Both may be async (scene-level restores use async store fromJSON).
 *   - Commands mutate ONLY through store APIs (shapeStore.add/remove,
 *     parameterStore.setValue, …) so the stores emit their normal events and
 *     every observer (canvas, panels, autosave) updates for free.
 *   - Commands capture the state they need at construction/execution time as
 *     plain JSON — never live object references that undo could corrupt.
 *   - `coalesceWith(next)` lets rapid same-target commands merge into one
 *     history entry (parameter slider drags, arrow-key nudge runs).
 *
 * Selection and viewport changes are deliberately NOT commands (not
 * undoable); commands that remove shapes restore selection in their own
 * undo instead.
 *
