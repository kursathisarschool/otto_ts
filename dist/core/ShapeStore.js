/**
 * @fileoverview Central repository for all shapes in a single scene, with
 * integrated selection management, edge-selection support, and joinery
 * metadata storage.
 *
 * Design patterns: Repository + Mediator
 *   - Repository -- ShapeStore is the single source of truth for every
 *     shape that exists in the current tab.  All reads and writes to shapes
 *     go through this class; no other module holds a long-lived, mutable
 *     reference to a shape outside of ShapeStore.
 *   - Mediator   -- ShapeStore sits at the intersection of several
 *     subsystems.  It holds a reference to ParameterStore (so it can
 *     resolve bindings) and to BindingResolver (which performs the actual
 *     resolution).  It also owns the edge-selection state and the
 *     joinery map, acting as the single place where edge-related queries
 *     from the UI can be answered without the UI needing to know about
 *     the geometry subsystem.
 *
 * Selection duality
 *   ShapeStore tracks selection in two parallel ways:
 *     - {@link ShapeStore#selectedShapeId}  -- a single ID, kept for
 *       backward compatibility with older UI code that only understands
 *       "the selected shape".
 *     - {@link ShapeStore#selectedShapeIds} -- a Set of IDs, used by
 *       newer code that supports rubber-band multi-selection.
 *   The two are kept in sync by every selection method.  The "primary"
 *   selection (selectedShapeId) is always the most-recently-added member
 *   of the Set, or null when the Set is empty.
 *
 * Edge selection
 *   When the user switches to edge-selection mode (e.g. to assign joinery
 *   to a woodworking joint), the store delegates the actual selected-edge
 *   bookkeeping to an {@link EdgeSelection} helper.  It also owns the
 *   {@link #edgeJoinery} map that persists joinery metadata across
 *   save/load cycles.
 *
 * Serialization
 *   {@link ShapeStore#toJSON} / {@link ShapeStore#fromJSON} round-trip the
 *   full state: shapes, selection IDs, and edge-joinery entries.  fromJSON
 *   is async because shape reconstruction requires a dynamic import of
 *   ShapeRegistry (to avoid circular dependencies at module-load time).
