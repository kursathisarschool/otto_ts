/**
 * @fileoverview Mediator that wires together the ShapeLibrary drag sources and
 * the canvas drop target so that a shape can be dragged out of the palette
 * and dropped onto the drawing area in a single fluid gesture.
 *
 * Design pattern: Mediator Pattern
 *   The ShapeLibrary and the CanvasRenderer know nothing about each other.
 *   DragDropManager is the single point that listens for drag-lifecycle
 *   events on both sides and translates them into the concrete actions
 *   (coordinate conversion, shape creation, store insertion) that make a
 *   drop actually work.
 *
 * Coordinate-space bridging
 *   Browser drag events report positions in CSS-pixel screen space relative
 *   to the viewport.  Otto's world coordinate system is independent of the
 *   viewport -- it pans and zooms.  A {@link DragDropManager#setScreenToWorldConverter}
 *   function is injected by the Application at startup; every drop position
 *   is run through that converter before the new shape is placed.
 *
 * Architectural role
 *   DragDropManager sits in the "core" layer.  It imports EventBus (the
 *   application-wide pub/sub bus) to receive SHAPE_DRAG_START / END signals
 *   that ShapeLibrary fires when the user initiates a drag.  It writes
 *   shapes directly into ShapeStore and reads shape-type metadata from
 *   ShapeRegistry, keeping the UI layer completely decoupled from the
 *   creation logic.
