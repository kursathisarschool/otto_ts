/**
 * @fileoverview Multi-tab scene management for Otto.
 *
 * Design patterns: Observer + Factory Method
 *   - Observer       -- TabManager does not modify the UI directly.  Every
 *     state change (tab created, closed, switched, renamed) is announced
 *     through the global {@link EventBus}, allowing the tab-bar UI and the
 *     CanvasRenderer to react independently without being coupled to this
 *     class.
 *   - Factory Method -- {@link TabManager#createTab} is the single entry
 *     point for producing new Tab objects.  It generates a unique ID,
 *     constructs a fresh {@link SceneState}, wraps them in a {@link Tab},
 *     and inserts it into the internal array.  No other code path should
 *     create tabs.
 *
 * Lifecycle rules
 *   - The last remaining tab can never be closed (the app always has at
 *     least one scene).
 *   - Creating a new tab does NOT auto-switch to it.  The user must
 *     explicitly click the tab to activate it.  The only exception is the
 *     very first tab created in the constructor, which becomes active
 *     because there is nothing else to stay on.
 *   - Closing the active tab auto-switches to the nearest adjacent tab
 *     (the one at the same index, or the last tab if the closed tab was at
 *     the end).
 *
 * Serialization
 *   {@link TabManager#toJSON} / {@link TabManager#fromJSON} persist the
 *   full tab list and the active-tab pointer.  fromJSON is async because
 *   {@link SceneState#fromJSON} performs dynamic imports internally.
 *

 * viewport state.
 *
 * @property {string}     id         Unique identifier generated at creation
 *     time (timestamp + random suffix).  Used as the key everywhere in

 *     (e.g. "Scene 1").  Mutable via {@link TabManager#renameTab}.
