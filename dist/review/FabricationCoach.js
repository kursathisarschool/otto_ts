/**
 * @fileoverview FabricationCoach — the review pipeline that turns a scene
 * summary into actionable design feedback via Gemini.
 *
 * This is the "brain" half of the review module: {@link GeminiProvider} is
 * transport-only, and {@link module:review/SceneSummary} distils the scene.
 * This class owns the *task*: it frames Gemini as a digital-fabrication design
 * coach, asks for structured JSON findings, and validates them into a stable
 * shape the UI can render without guessing.
 *
 * The persona mirrors Otto's purpose — teaching parametric design for digital
 * fabrication (laser cutting, CNC, 3D-printed jigs). So the coach flags the
 * things that actually bite a student at the machine: joints thinner than the
 * material, dimensions that should be parameters but are hard-coded, missing
 * relationships between pieces, and "what could go wrong" when the design is
 * fabricated — the same spirit as the classroom AI-teacher feedback loop.
