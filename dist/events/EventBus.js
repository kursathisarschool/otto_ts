/**
 * @fileoverview Application-wide publish/subscribe event bus.
 *
 * Design patterns: Singleton + Observer
 *   - Singleton  -- there is exactly one EventBus in the entire application.
 *     Every module that needs to publish or listen to events imports the
 *     same instance (the default export).  The class itself is also exported
 *     so that tests can access {@link EventBus.getInstance} directly.
 *   - Observer   -- components register interest in a named event type by
 *     passing a callback to {@link EventBus#subscribe}.  When any other
 *     component calls {@link EventBus#emit} with that same type, every
 *     registered callback is invoked with the emitted payload.
 *
 * Architectural role
 *   EventBus is the nervous system of Otto.  It is the ONLY channel through
 *   which the core layer (ShapeStore, ParameterStore, TabManager, etc.)
 *   notifies the UI layer (CanvasRenderer, PropertiesPanel, ShapeLibrary)
 *   that something has changed.  Neither side holds a direct reference to
 *   the other; they are coupled only through event-type strings.  This makes
 *   it straightforward to add new UI panels or new data stores without
 *   modifying existing code.
 *
 * Error isolation
 *   Each callback is invoked inside its own try/catch.  A bug in one
 *   subscriber's handler will be logged to the console but will not prevent
 *   the remaining subscribers from being notified.
 *
 * @module events/EventBus
