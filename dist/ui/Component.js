 * CanvasRenderer, etc.) extends this class.
 *
 * Responsibilities
 * -----------------
 * 1. **Lifecycle management** -- mount() / unmount() provide a predictable two-phase
 *    lifecycle.  mount() calls the subclass render() hook; unmount() tears down the
 *    DOM and removes every EventBus listener that was registered through subscribe().
 *
 * 2. **EventBus subscription tracking** -- subscribe() wraps EventBus.subscribe() and
 *    captures the returned unsubscribe function in an internal array.  On unmount()
 *    every captured unsubscribe is invoked automatically, so subclasses never need to
 *    track their own cleanup.  This is the primary mechanism that prevents memory leaks
 *    caused by stale listeners.
 *
 * 3. **DOM helper** -- createElement() is a thin factory that understands 'class' ->
 *    className mapping, data-* attributes via setAttribute, and polymorphic content
 *    (string, Node, or Array<string|Node>).
 *

     * - The key `'class'` is mapped to `element.className` rather than
     *   setAttribute, because className is the standard programmatic API and
     *   avoids quirks with classList vs class in older browsers.
     * - Keys that start with `'data-'` are set via `setAttribute` so they appear
     *   in the DOM and are queryable with `[data-*]` selectors.  This is
     *   important for drag-and-drop payloads (e.g. `data-shape-type`).
     * - All other keys are assigned directly as element properties
     *   (e.g. `draggable`, `title`, `value`).
     *
     * Content handling rules:
     * - `string` -- sets textContent (fast path, no extra nodes).
     * - `Node` -- appended as a single child.
     * - `Array<string|Node>` -- each item is appended in order; strings become
     *   text nodes.  This lets callers mix static labels and dynamic child
     *   elements without manual DOM manipulation.
     * - `null` (default) -- nothing is appended; the element is left empty.
     *
     * @param {string} tag - HTML tag name (e.g. 'div', 'button', 'span').
     * @param {Object<string, *>} [attributes={}] - Key/value map of attributes
     *   or properties to apply to the new element.  See rules above.
     * @param {string|Node|Array<string|Node>|null} [content=null] - Initial
     *   content to place inside the element.  See rules above.
