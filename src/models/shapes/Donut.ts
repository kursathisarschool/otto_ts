/**
 * @fileoverview Donut (annulus / washer) -- a ring-shaped region between two concentric
 * circles.
 *
 * The Donut deviates from the standard shape patterns in three notable ways:
 *
 *   1. getBounds() is computed analytically (centre +/- outerRadius) instead of
 *      delegating to a geometry path.  The bounding box of a circle is trivially known,
 *      so there is no reason to pay the cost of path construction just for bounds.
 *
 *   2. containsPoint() uses a direct Euclidean distance check:
 *          innerRadius <= dist(point, centre) <= outerRadius
 *      This is O(1) and exact, whereas the path-based styleContainsPoint approach would
 *      require constructing the full winding-rule path.  The distance check is both faster
 *      and more accurate for circular annuli.
 *
 *   3. The geometry path (used for rendering, edge extraction, and boolean operations)
 *      encodes the hole via the non-zero winding rule.  The outer circle is traced
 *      counter-clockwise (forward), a zero-length "bridge" segment connects it to the
 *      inner circle's starting point, and the inner circle is traced clockwise (backward,
 *      i.e. the loop index decrements).  When this single closed path is filled with the
 *      non-zero winding rule, the inner region winds to zero and is left unfilled --
 *      producing the hole.
 *
 * The render() method uses the native canvas arc() API with the {@code anticlockwise}
 * flag set to true for the inner circle.  This achieves the same winding-rule hole
 * effect using the browser's built-in arc primitives, which is faster than emitting
 * the sampled polygon path.
